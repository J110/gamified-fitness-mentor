# 01 — Product Overview (One Page)

## Goal
Demonstrate a gamification system that converts assessment tracking into:
- Life-chapter stage classification
- Adaptive mentor narrative (ideal-self coach)
- Adaptive skill cards (micro-actions)
- Progress/rewards (Momentum, Mentor Trust, Identity Titles, Unlocks)
…and visibly updates when user completes cards.

## Chapters
1. HEALTH
2. FINANCE
3. PURPOSE (job/meaning)
4. RELATIONSHIPS

## Stages (per chapter)
- STOP_LOSS — "Holding the Line"
- START_GAIN — "Finding Rhythm"
- IMPROVE — "Raising the Bar"

## Demo flow
1. User fills seed inputs: gender, age, profession, work environment (indoor/outdoor/mixed), smoker.
2. App shows assessment tables with blanks.
3. User clicks "Generate Tracking" → deterministic random values (seeded) appear + interpretations.
4. Dashboard shows 4 chapters with score+stage; current chapter highlighted (lowest score by default).
5. Mentor (D‑ID video) delivers narrative aligned to current chapter + stage + weak metrics.
6. 3 skill cards appear; user completes none/partial/full.
7. Progress updates; mentor responds; next cards adapt; stage highlight can change.
8. Reset returns to step 1 (new user).

## Avatar approach for demo (recommended)
- Offer 4–8 pre-selected high-quality mentor headshots (licensed/stock)
- Let user choose one + voice style
- Use D-ID to generate talking head video per mentor line
- Optional: later add user selfie upload as the source image (works with D-ID) but do NOT block demo on camera reliability
